Since we are looking at video data, it makes sense for the data to exhibit clustering due to the videos being from the same creator or be regarding the same topic. Videos from the same creator may consistently receive high/low number of views and ratings. Therefore, the IID assumption may not be met.

(Need to elaborate more on this.)
